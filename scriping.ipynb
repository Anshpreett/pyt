The arrested individual, Itmiaz, also known as Arman Alam, employed catapults to shatter car windows outside malls and markets, swiftly making off with valuable items, primarily laptops. The recent surge in such thefts prompted intensified search efforts, leading to Itmiaz's arrest near Noida Sector 45's Amrapali Sapphire. Authorities are currently actively pursuing Itmiaz's accomplice, Harvansh also known as Anil Bhati. Itmiaz, active since 2015, had a distinct modus operandi—carrying a spy camera to document his actions and maintaining a diary with information about cases against him and the questions asked during interrogations, noting the respective police officers. Driven by a desire to impress girls and live a luxurious lifestyle, Itmiaz engaged in criminal activities. Police discovered numerous cameras both in and around his Faridabad residence, suggesting surveillance of the neighborhood to evade potential police approaches. Seized items from Itmiaz's house include a digital video recorder containing saved footage, three laptops, two empty bags, an Aadhaar card, a spy camera, a scooty, and Rs 5,000 in cash. In March, four members of the 'thak thak' gang were apprehended, recovering stolen valuables worth over Rs 30 lakh, including 27 laptops, from them.\"},\n",
